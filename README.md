## Short description

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

The dataset includes house sale prices for King County in USA which were sold in May, 2014 and May, 2015.

Description of the data set headres:

*ida: notation for a house
*date: Date house was sold
*price: Price is prediction target
*bedrooms: Number of Bedrooms/House
*bathrooms: Number of bathrooms/House
*sqft_living: square footage of the home
*sqft_lot: square footage of the lot
*floors: Total floors (levels) in house
*waterfront: House which has a view to a waterfront
*view: Has been viewed
*condition: How good the condition is ( Overall )
*grade: overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
*sqft_abovesquare: footage of house apart from basement
*sqft_basement: square footage of the basement
*yr_built: Built Year
*yr_renovated: Year when house was renovated
*zipcode: zip
*lat: Latitude coordinate
*long: Longitude coordinate
*sqft_living15: Living room area in 2015(implies-- some renovations)
*sqft_lot15: lotSize area in 2015(implies-- some renovations)

## Problem statement

Build the models of predicting the houses prices using ridge and lasso regresion and compare the result.
